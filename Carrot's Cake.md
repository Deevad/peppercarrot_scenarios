**Note:** The idea for this scenario is that there should be no words, since is centered on Carrot's character, I think is fun to instead use Pictures in place, like this is not entirely "silent" and dialogs would be done with graphics.

## Scene 1: Preparation for Carrot's Birthday, first guest.

**Panel 1:** Pepper,s cottage can be seen from a few meters away while She is putting some Birthday decorations on a table just on the side of her home (on the yard) in what it looks like a nice sunny day.

**Panel 2** Saffron arrive with some fancy wrapped present, Truffel has a tiny prensent on its mouth while wearing a flower head piece (to impress Carrot).

**Panel 3** On one of the cottage windows Carrot is "piking" with its face squizeed all over the glass full of exitement (very happy face).

**Panel 4** Saffron gives Pepper the present for Carrot.

**Panel 5** Carrot is getting ready to meet the guest, "combing" its hair with its paw while running out the door (anthropomorphically as usual).

**Panel 8:** Yuzu comes out with a smirky smile while Shichimi follows him with a very innocent manner, as if coming out of the misterious fog was a normal way of appearing, she has a present wrapped in a clothe "furoshiki". 

**Panel 9:** Saffron is a bit upset but relieved.

They are all confused and scared.

**Panel 25:** Everybody Is enjoing a modest party eating cake at the table except for Carrot who seems to feel nauseous about his own slice of cake, while thinking on fruits.

## The End.

**Post-Notes:** Another idea it came to my mind was to have a ghost-like heads of the pets in top of the self-ingredients instead of only their eyes/mouth on the actual ingredient package, I also thought about doing their heads in a speach bubble as in "thinking" yet I think that one may be too introusive or bussy.

Also the ideas for the images in the speech bubbles is that they supposed to be way more simple than the regular comic, for instance Carrot's would be a much simplyfied version of itself, like dot eyes instead of the full eye with the pupil. etc. Making the images look very cartooninsh. and separate them from the actual comic style.
