# Scenarios

![alt tag](http://www.peppercarrot.com/extras/logos/Peppercarrot-logo_alpha_512.png)

Hey writers, welcome to a git repository with free, open and collaborative scenarios for the webcomic project [Pepper&Carrot](http://wwww.peppercarrot.com). This repository exist in the purpose to build together a better entertaining experience around Pepper&Carrot and better future episodes.

## Resources

Description of the world Hereva can be found in the [ Wiki ](https://github.com/Deevad/peppercarrot/wiki). 

## Formating style

The scenarios are stored as markdown *.md files and written in english. Any text-editor on any polatform can write markdown. It's simple, lightweight, and focus on content; that's why I selected it. To know the possibilities of markdown, check the [ basic writing and formatting syntax ](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).

The webcomic scenario start with the filename with space characters replaced with underscore ( eg. my_title.md ). The filename doesn't have to be the final title of the scenario, it's hard to start writing with the final title. You can use a temporary codename and rename it later.

On the top of the file: the title.

```# My super title```

Then a list of author/contributors:

``` Author: name <email@email.com>, second name <email@email.com> ```

The date, the revision version, etc... will be handled by git itself. No need to add them.

You can start a scene like this:

```**First scene:** scene description```

And add a panel like this:

```

**Panel 1:** Visual description of the panel

**Character1:** content of his/her speechbubble

**Character2:** content of his/her speechbubble

```

If you are not familiar with Github, you can ask me ( info@davidrevoy.com ) collaborator permission to directly edit the markdown files online with the Github interface.
