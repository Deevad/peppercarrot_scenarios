![alt tag](http://www.peppercarrot.com/extras/logos/Peppercarrot-logo_alpha_512.png)

Hey writers, welcome to a git repository with free, open and collaborative scenarios for the webcomic project [Pepper&Carrot](http://wwww.peppercarrot.com). This repository exist in the purpose to build together a better entertaining experience around Pepper&Carrot and better future episodes.

## Resources

Description of the world Hereva can be found in the [ Wiki ](https://github.com/Deevad/peppercarrot/wiki). 

## Formating style

Check the file **template.md** in this repository for formatting style.

The scenarios are stored as markdown *.md files and written in english. Any text-editor on any operating system can write markdown. You can even edit it directly online. It's simple, lightweight, and focus on content; that's why I favor it. To know the possibilities of markdown, check the [ basic writing and formatting syntax ](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).
