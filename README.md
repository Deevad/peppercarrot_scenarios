## Formating style

Check the other scenarios in this repository to have an idea of the formating style. The file **template.md** will help you to get started.

The scenarios are stored as markdown *.md files and written in english. Any text-editor on any operating system can write markdown. You can even edit it directly online. It's simple, lightweight, and focus on content; that's why I favor it. To know the possibilities of markdown, check the [ basic writing and formatting syntax ](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).
