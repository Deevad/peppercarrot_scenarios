Landscape view on Pepper's house in autumn.  
*Pepper (speechbubble coming through the windows)*: What?

---

@cmaloney

Inside Pepper's house. She is at the table with her books all scattered about. Her head is in her hands. Carrot looks like he was just woken up and has the annoyed look that all cats have when they realize it was just the nonsense of humans that awoke him.  
*Pepper*: This doesn't make any sense at all.

---

@valvin

Carrot is still thinking why he is not sleeping but tries to take interest in Pepper's worries. He is approaching the table but as he is not well awaked he falls because of Pepper's broom stick. 

---

@nartance

Carrot got up, confused by his fall, while Pepper started to grumble.  
*Pepper*: I have searched in each book of this home, but nothing! No one talks about it! I will go mad!

---

@Jookia

Carrot jumps up on to the table peers at the books. Most are history related to
the magic schools. She looks up and notices him, sighing.

*Pepper*: Remember the impossible triangle, Carrot? Six magic schools connected?  
She points to a cut out triangle she drew, mirroring an image in an open book.
Carrot peers at it, almost angry at it for puzzling Pepper.

![The impossible triangle](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/83c58f72d5c6e9ac6a0e1165dc149c496a3a5e8d/68747470733a2f2f7777772e706570706572636172726f742e636f6d2f305f736f75726365732f30746865722f617274776f726b732f6c6f772d7265732f323031352d30362d30385f6d616769632d73797374656d2d6f662d6865726576615f62792d44617669642d5265766f792e6a7067)

*Pepper*: It makes no sense! Chaosah is the root of all magic, but here it's just another corner.  
Carrot compares the triangle to the impossible triangle in the book.

*Pepper*: Even so, if it were the root wouldn't Ah and Zombiah connect?  
Carrot is unsuccessfully folding the cut out triangle to make it look like the image.

*Pepper*: So maybe it means something else? But why don't the corners connect? It's almost as if they–  
Carrot only manages to fold it in to a 3D triangle (tetrahedron) before giving up.

The tetrahedron catches Pepper's eye, so she picks it up examines it.  
*Pepper*: ...don't want to connect.

---

@Zveryok

Carrot sits on the table and looks at Pepper with interest, as she examines that tetrahedron.

---

@cmaloney

As Pepper is about to close the book Carrot notices a reflective glint off of the paper. His eyes grow wide and he begins to waggle as if about to pounce on the book.

---

@deevad

Wide shot on the lab of Pepper: Carrot is now chasing a magical mouse made of red light. Carrot's facial expression display serious instinct about hunting this small creature and he even shows his claws. We can guess the magical mouse escaped the book and now jump on stacks of books in the labs (we can see a zigzag path of red light from her position to the book.). The book violently re-opened to let the mouse escapes. Pepper on the shot is surprised by the shock of the cover of the book hitting the desk, she was supposed to almost close the book on the previous shot. All the thin tubes in glass containing future potions and experiment on the labs shakes, other books too.

@qtwyeuritoiy (aka imsesaok)

Close shot following Carrot: As Carrot continues to chase the small red mouse, he accidentally pushes the blue and red flasks with his legs to fall. Pepper catches them quickly by hand before it fell to the ground.  
*Pepper*: Carrot, stop what you're...  
Pepper's agitated voice stated to trail away as she saw someone beside an open door.

---

@cmaloney

Thyme emerges through the door. 

*Thyme*: What's with all this racket? 

Thyme notices the red mouse. Her eyes widen.

---

@valvin

Wide-shot on the room. 
Thyme at the door is looking anxious to what happened. She looks at the red mouse. Pepper looks confused the flask in her hand. Carrot is ready to jump on the mouse.
We can see books and flasks are still shaking. 

*Thyme* (thoughts): "How is that possible!? The Red Door has been reopened! It might open only if ..."

---

@midgard

Carrot senses something's amiss. He looks from the flasks in Pepper's hand to Thyme, then back to Pepper. The mouse quickly jumps away. Thyme regains her posture after being startled, but not in time to prevent the mouse from escaping through the open door.

*Thyme*: *Porta Claudenda Rubra Obsignoque Portam Rubram!*

The book snaps shut and stops glowing, but Pepper realizes the mouse is still outside.

@raspbeguy

Carrot realises that the mouse he was ready to eat just a few seconds ago seems to be more important that he thought.

*Pepper*: "We cannot let this mouse be in contact with people of our world. It could be..."

Pepper suddenly seems like she understands something very important. She looks in the direction of the books she was studying.

---

@Zveryok

While Pepper is looking in the direction of the books, Carrot is trying to find the mouse, but the mouse is hidden well enough that he can't find her.

---

@qtwyeuritoiy (aka imsesaok)

Pepper's POV: Pepper felt something tingling on her left foot and she freaked out.

---

@calimeroteknik

Pepper looks down just in time to see the magic mouse fall on the floor from the jolt, and reform to become the impossible triangle. It looks correctly, impossibly assembled.  
Mesmerized by what she has spent hours trying to figure out, Pepper leans towards the glittering hypergonic figure to pick it up…

*Thyme interrupts her*: Pepper, no!! Don't touch it!

Regaining her senses, Pepper stops her hand mere centimeters from the catastrophe.

---

@cmaloney

The mouse, seizing on the opportunity, jumps onto Pepper's finger and scurries up her sleeve. Pepper is surprised by this, but even more surprised by how ticklish its little feet are. Carrot sees the sudden movement and positions himself to intercept. Thyme notices the confusion and also tries to intercept the mouse.

---

@Jookia

The mouse jumps out of Pepper's shirt and off her neck.
Carrot and Thyme jump at the mouse but knock in to each other.
Pepper chases the mouse outside, but doesn't catch it.

---

@Zveryok or @imsesaok or @cmaloney - Battle it out or something
@cmaloney

Carrot runs off chasing the mouse at top speed. His cat-like agility is almost even with the mouse.

Pepper is exhausted. She stands with her hands on her knees. She is out of breath. Thyme floats over where Pepper is panting. 

Thyme: You didn't listen to me! You don't know what you're dealing with here.

Pepper looks up at Thyme with surprise and disgust. 

Pepper: What was that thing? 

Thyme: It's a mouse that Qualicity invented. It seems to have a way of camouflaging itself as the thing you desire most when it's cornered. When you reach out to touch it it uses that desire against you to escape. 

Pepper: The Impossible Triangle. I wanted to understand it. 

Thyme: I lost track when I was studying it to see how it worked. 

Pepper: What did it turn into when you were studying it? 

---

@calimeroteknik

Thyme looks away in an attempt to dissumulate her embarrassment, but quickly recovers.  
Pepper could have sworn that if her face weren't that of a zombie, it would be as red as a tomato.

Thyme: Ahem. This is no time to be telling stories of the past. We have more pressing matters to tend to.

Thyme sighs.  
Thyme: I was hoping to have returned to the Chaos before this farce would resurface… There's no helping it now. We have to call a meeting of the schools.

Pepper: What are you talking about?

Thyme: That book you were engrossing yourself in. It was written when I was young…  
The Qualicity academy, the Magmah college and the school of Hippiah wanter to gather all the knowledge about Hereva's magic. They came bombarding us with questions, too… The impossible triangle was first introduced in that book, and to celebrate, they came up with the stupid idea of embedding a token from each school in it.

Remembering the events, Thyme sighs again.
