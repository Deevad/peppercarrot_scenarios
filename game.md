Landscape view on Pepper's house in autumn.  
Pepper (speechbubble coming through the windows): What?

Inside Pepper's house. She is at the table with her books all scattered about. Her head is in her hands. Carrot looks like he was just woken up and has the annoyed look that all cats have when they realize it was just the nonsense of humans that awoke him.  
Pepper: This doesn't make any sense at all.

Carrot is still thinking why he is not sleeping but tries to take interest in Pepper's worries. He is approaching the table but as he is not well awaked he falls because of Pepper's broom stick.

@nartance

Carrot got up, confused by his fall, while Pepper started to grumble.  
Pepper: I have searched in each book of this home, but nothing! No one talks about it! I will go mad!

Carrot jumps up on to the table peers at the books. Most are history related to
the magic schools. She looks up and notices him, sighing.

"Remember the impossible triangle, Carrot? Six magic schools connected?"
She points to a cut out triangle she drew, mirroring an image in an open book.
Carrot peers at it, almost angry at it for puzzling Pepper.

"It makes no sense! Chaosah is the root of all magic, but here it's just another corner."
Carrot compares the triangle to the impossible triangle in the book.

"Even so, if it were the root wouldn't Ah and Zombiah connect?"
Carrot is unsuccessfully folding the cut out triangle to make it look like the image.

"So maybe it means something else? But why don't the corners connect? It's almost as if they-"
Carrot only manages to fold it in to a 3D triangle (tetrahedron) before giving up.

The tetrahedron catches Pepper's eye, so she picks it up examines it.
"don't want to connect."

Carrot sits on the table and looks at Pepper with interest, as she examines that tetrahedron.

@cmaloney

As Pepper is about to close the book Carrot notices a reflective glint off of the paper. His eyes grow wide and he begins to waggle as if about to pounce on the book.
