Landscape view on Pepper's house in autumn.  
Pepper (speechbubble coming through the windows): What?

Inside Pepper's house. She is at the table with her books all scattered about. Her head is in her hands. Carrot looks like he was just woken up and has the annoyed look that all cats have when they realize it was just the nonsense of humans that awoke him.  
Pepper: This doesn't make any sense at all.

Carrot is still thinking why he is not sleeping but tries to take interest in Pepper's worries. He is approaching the table but as he is not well awaked he falls because of Pepper's broom stick.
